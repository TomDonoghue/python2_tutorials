# Python2 Tutorials

These are a set of introductory notebooks for python (2), specifically towards Data Science applications, focused on basic concepts. They are designed to be 'first looks', showing a brief overview of the area, and then linking out to more in depth materials. 

These notebooks were first developed as extra materials for the COGS 9 - Introduction to Data Science class at UC San Diego. 

NOTES:
- These notebooks are not under active development, and may well be outdated. They were written quite a long time ago, and I offer no guarantee they suggest current best practices. 
- This repository will be superceded by a similar, up to date, set of notebooks currently being developed in Python3 for COGS 108 (Data Science in Practice) - coming soon.
