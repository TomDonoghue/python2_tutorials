# Python2 Tutorials

## NOTE: This repository is effectively deprecated (not under active development / probably out of date)

These materials have been superceded by newer materials:
- For Python & Data science in general, new materials at: https://github.com/COGS108/Overview
  - Updated version of these notebooks (and others): https://github.com/COGS108/SectionMaterials
- Python Overview in General: https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp

As un-solicited advice, I would recommend using Python3 (instead of 2) if you're looking at jumping into Python. 

### Old outline

These are a set of introductory notebooks for python (2), specifically towards Data Science applications, focused on basic concepts. They are designed to be 'first looks', showing a brief overview of the area, and then linking out to more in depth materials.
